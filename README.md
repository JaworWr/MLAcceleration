# MLAcceleration

This is the code from my Master's thesis "Multidimensional extrapolation methods with some machine learning
applications" at the University of Wroc≈Çaw.

## Files

* `extrapolation.py` - contains implementations of the tested extrapolation methods
* `experiments.py`, `logistic_regression.py` - code for experiments with logistic regression
* `nn_extrapolation.py` - implementation of acceleration methods for neural networks
* `nn_utils.py` - helper code for neural network experiments
